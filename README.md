# 🧠 RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program — Weekly Reports

This document contains all my weekly project reports for the **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program** (10-week open-source VLSI design training).  
All work was done using open-source tools — Icarus Verilog, GTKWave, Ngspice, Yosys, OpenSTA, and OpenLane with the Sky130 PDK.

| Week | Topic | GitHub Repository | Description | Status |
|------|--------|------------------|--------------|---------|
| **Week 0** | Tool Installation & Environment Setup | [GitHub Link](https://github.com/Dhinu29/P_DINESH_WEEK_0_RISC_V_SoC_Tapeout_Program_VSD) | Installed and configured all open-source tools (Icarus Verilog, GTKWave, Ngspice, Yosys, OpenSTA, OpenLane, Magic, KLayout, Sky130 PDK). Verified environment on Ubuntu. | ✅ Completed |
| **Week 1** | Digital Design Flow: RTL, Simulation & Synthesis | [GitHub Link](https://github.com/Dhinu29/P_DINESH_WEEK_1_RISC_V_SoC_Tapeout_Program_VSD) |  Designed Verilog RTL modules (combinational & sequential logic),Simulated using Icarus Verilog and analyzed waveforms in GTKWave,Synthesized the RTL to a gate-level netlist with Yosys (targeting a standard cell library) | ✅ Completed |
| **Week 2** | Pre/Post-Synthesis Simulation & Synthesis of VSDBabySoC | [GitHub Link](https://github.com/Dhinu29/P_DINESH_WEEK_2_RISC_V_SoC_Tapeout_Program_VSD) |Performed pre-synthesis RTL simulation, synthesized the design using Yosys, and verified functionality with post-synthesis gate-level simulation of VSDBabySoC. | ✅ Completed |
| **Week 3** | Static Timing Analysis (STA) Fundamentals | [GitHub Link](https://github.com/Dhinu29/P_DINESH_WEEK_3_RISC_V_SoC_Tapeout_Program_VSD) | Performed Static Timing Analysis using OpenSTA to check timing of the synthesized VSDBabySoC netlist and ensured design meets constraints. | ✅ Completed |
| **Week 4** | Ngspice Analog Simulation | [GitHub Link](https://github.com/yourusername/week4_repo) | Simulated analog/mixed-signal circuits (inverter, op-amp) using **Ngspice** with Sky130 device models. | ✅ Completed |
